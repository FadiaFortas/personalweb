          Since I was young, I wanted to become a doctor. This is so clich√©,
          especially here in Algeria! But wait, was it all? Of course not! at
          the age of 16 years old, I literally found my passion: science, human
          help, blood and surgery. Besides that, I am a Grey's Anatomy fan and
          this TV show shaped my highschool. I was discovering more aspects of
          medical life and trying to compare myself eachtime if I will be able
          to take this job as a life one, or it is just a teenager's excitement?
          By the end of my highshool, I knew that I can't be anything but a
          doctor!
